# Legacy_Playlist

Thanks for using the [Legacy Playlist](https://www.website.com)!


<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and the how of your project. Use the following as a guide: -->

- The motivation for this web app was the thought of hearing great music, but not being able to add it to your library for whatever reason. NO MORE!
- We built this project as a test to see if we can put what I learn into practice, while having a practical use, with the possible goal of becoming an actual music platform in the future.
- This page gives the user a space to store music information that they can use at anytime from the palm of their hand.
- With this, we have shown what we learned in basic understanding of coding with html, css, and javascript, and how to execute them together.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This web app is for storing information on music so you can never forget about it again! How could you when you have all its information? When you are told the name of a song and who sings it but you cant add it to your major music playform for whatever reason, Legacy Playlist has your back. When low bandwidth required, you can get the name or artist of any song you stored. Simple, but you'd be surprised how often this happens.
